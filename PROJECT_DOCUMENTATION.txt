                              1. WHAT IS OUR PROJECT?
================================================================================

🛍️ PROJECT NAME: AR Shopping Website

🎯 WHAT IT DOES:
- It's like an online shopping website (similar to Amazon or Flipkart)
- BUT with a special feature: customers can "try on" clothes using their camera
- This is called "Augmented Reality" (AR) - like Instagram filters but for shopping

🏗️ HOW IT'S BUILT:
Our website has TWO main parts:
1. BACKEND (Server) - Stores all the data, handles requests
2. FRONTEND (Website) - What users see and interact with

Think of it like a restaurant:
- BACKEND = Kitchen (where food is prepared, recipes are stored)
- FRONTEND = Dining area (where customers sit, see menu, place orders)

================================================================================
                           2. WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DID WE USE?
================================================================================

🔧 BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Python - Programming language (like English for computers)
2. Django - Web framework (pre-built tools for websites)
3. Django REST Framework - Makes it easy to create APIs
4. SQLite - Database (like a digital filing cabinet for data)

🎨 FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES:
1. JavaScript - Programming language for websites
2. React - Library to build user interfaces
3. Vite - Tool to build and run our React app
4. Tailwind CSS - Pre-made styles to make things look pretty
5. React Router - Helps navigate between different pages

🌐 COMMUNICATION:
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - Allows frontend and backend to talk
- REST API - A way for frontend to request data from backend
- JSON - Format for sending data (like a universal language)

================================================================================
                        3. PROJECT STRUCTURE (FOLDERS & FILES)

                           4. BACKEND (DJANGO) - THE SERVER SIDE
================================================================================

🏗️ WHAT IS THE BACKEND?

The backend is like the "brain" of our website. It:
- Stores all product information (names, prices, images)
- Manages user accounts (registration, login)
- Provides data to the frontend when requested
- Handles business logic (like calculating discounts)

🔧 DJANGO APPS (MODULES):

Our Django project has 4 main apps (think of them as departments):

1. USERS APP 📱
   Purpose: Manage user accounts
   What it does:
   - Store user information (username, email, password)
   - Handle user registration and login
   - Manage user profiles and settings

2. CATALOG APP 🛍️
   Purpose: Manage products and categories
   What it does:
   - Store product information (name, price, description, images)
   - Organize products by categories (shirts, jeans, shoes)
   - Manage brands (Nike, Adidas, Levi's)
   - Provide search and filtering capabilities

3. TRYON APP 👕
   Purpose: Handle AR try-on features
   What it does:
   - Store AR-related data for products
   - Manage try-on sessions
   - Handle AR model data

4. DASHBOARD APP 📊
   Purpose: Admin interface
   What it does:
   - Provide statistics about the website
   - Allow admins to manage content
   - Show reports and analytics

🗃️ DATABASE MODELS (DATA STRUCTURE):

Think of models as blueprints for storing data:

USER MODEL:
- username (text)
- email (text)
- password (encrypted text)
- first_name (text)
- last_name (text)
- date_joined (date)

PRODUCT MODEL:
- name (text) - "Nike Air Max"
- slug (text) - "nike-air-max" (URL-friendly version)
- description (long text)
- price (number with decimals)
- category (link to Category)
- brand (link to Brand)
- images (multiple product photos)
- is_active (true/false)
- is_featured (true/false)
- ar_enabled (true/false)

CATEGORY MODEL:
- name (text) - "Sneakers"
- slug (text) - "sneakers"
- description (text)

BRAND MODEL:
- name (text) - "Nike"
- slug (text) - "nike"
- logo (image file)

🌐 API ENDPOINTS (HOW FRONTEND TALKS TO BACKEND):

Our backend provides these "endpoints" (like phone numbers for different services):

GET /api/catalog/products/
- Purpose: Get list of all products
- Example response: [{"id": 1, "name": "T-shirt", "price": "25.99"}]

GET /api/catalog/products/nike-air-max/
- Purpose: Get details of one specific product
- Uses product slug instead of ID for better URLs

GET /api/catalog/categories/
- Purpose: Get list of all categories

GET /api/catalog/brands/
- Purpose: Get list of all brands

GET /api/catalog/stats/
- Purpose: Get website statistics

================================================================================
                         5. FRONTEND (REACT) - THE USER INTERFACE
================================================================================

🎨 WHAT IS THE FRONTEND?

The frontend is what users see and interact with. It's like the "face" of our website:
- Beautiful user interface with buttons, images, text
- Responsive design (works on phones, tablets, computers)
- Interactive features (clicking, scrolling, forms)
- Real-time updates when data changes

⚛️ REACT CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:

1. COMPONENTS 🧩
   Think of components like LEGO blocks:
   - Each component is a reusable piece of UI
   - You can combine them to build complete pages
   - Example: Header, Footer, ProductCard, Button

2. PROPS 📦
   Props are like passing notes between components:
   - Parent component gives data to child component
   - Example: Home page gives product data to ProductCard

3. STATE 📊
   State is like the component's memory:
   - Stores data that can change
   - Example: user login status, shopping cart items

4. HOOKS 🎣
   Hooks are special functions that add powers to components:
   - useState: Remembers data
   - useEffect: Runs code when something changes
   - useContext: Shares data across many components

📄 OUR MAIN PAGES:

1. HOME PAGE (Home.jsx) 🏠

   What it does:
   - Links to product detail page
   - Shows AR badge for AR-enabled products
   - Handles wishlist functionality

🎨 STYLING WITH TAILWIND CSS:

Tailwind CSS is like having a box of pre-made building blocks for styling:
- Instead of writing custom CSS, we use class names
- Example: "bg-blue-500" makes background blue
- "text-white" makes text white
- "rounded-lg" makes corners rounded
- "hover:bg-blue-600" changes color on mouse hover

We configured Tailwind to use version 3 for better compatibility.

🌓 DARK/LIGHT MODE:

We implemented a theme system:
- ThemeContext stores current theme (light or dark)
- ThemeProvider wraps entire app to share theme data
- Components use theme to change colors
- Toggle button in header switches themes
- Setting is remembered between visits

================================================================================
                       6. HOW BOTH PARTS TALK TO EACH OTHER
================================================================================

🔄 THE COMMUNICATION FLOW:

1. USER ACTION:
   User clicks "View Products" button on homepage

2. FRONTEND REACTION:
   React component calls API service function

3. API REQUEST:
   Frontend sends HTTP request to backend
   Example: GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/catalog/products/

4. BACKEND PROCESSING:
   Django receives request
   Queries database for products
   Converts data to JSON format

5. BACKEND RESPONSE:
   Sends JSON data back to frontend
   Example: {"results": [{"name": "T-shirt", "price": "25.99"}]}

6. FRONTEND UPDATE:
   React receives data
   Updates component state
   Re-renders UI with new data

🌐 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Problem: By default, browsers block requests between different origins
Our situation: 
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:5174
- Backend runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Solution: We configured Django to allow requests from our frontend
File: ar_tryon_backend/settings.py
Setting: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes our frontend URL

📡 API SERVICE (api.js):

This file handles all communication with backend:
- Creates axios instance with base URL
- Sets default headers
- Provides functions for different API calls:
  - getProducts() - fetches product list
  - getProduct(slug) - fetches single product
  - getCategories() - fetches categories
  - getBrands() - fetches brands

📊 DATA FORMAT (JSON):

Example of product data sent between frontend and backend:
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "501 Original Fit Jeans",
  "slug": "levis-501-original-fit-jeans",
  "price": "89.99",
  "brand": {
    "name": "Levi's",
    "slug": "levis"
  },
  "category": {
    "name": "Jeans",
    "slug": "jeans"
  },
  "images": [
    {
      "image": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/products/jeans1.jpg",
      "alt_text": "Jeans front view",
      "is_primary": true
    }
  ],
  "ar_enabled": true,
  "is_featured": true
}

                           12. TECHNICAL TERMS EXPLAINED
================================================================================

📚 GLOSSARY FOR BEGINNERS:

API (Application Programming Interface):
A way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Like a waiter in a restaurant who takes your order (request) to the kitchen (backend) and brings back your food (response).

BACKEND:
The server-side of a web application that handles data storage, business logic, and provides APIs. Users don't directly interact with it.

COMPONENT:
In React, a reusable piece of UI code that can be combined to build complete interfaces. Like building blocks.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
